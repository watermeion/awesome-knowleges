# 怎么样保证自己的代码质量

# 代码规范

# 静态代码分析

# 合理组织自己的功能
Keep the commit log as healthy as the code. It is one of the first places new contributors will look at the project.

No more than one change per commit. There should be no changes in a commit which are unrelated to its message.
Follow these conventions when writing the commit message.
Keep the diffs as clean as possible. Avoid unnecessary line changes.
When filing a Pull Request, make sure it is rebased on top of most recent master. If you need to modify it or amend it in some way, you should always appropriately fixup the issues in git and force-push your changes to your fork.
