## Turing completeness

wikipedia 关于命令语言是图灵完备的解释

an imperative language is Turing complete if it has conditional branching (e.g., "if" and "goto" statements, or a "branch if zero" instruction; see one instruction set computer) and the ability to change an arbitrary amount of memory (e.g., the ability to maintain an arbitrary number of data items). Of course, no physical system can have infinite memory; but if the limitation of finite memory is ignored, most programming languages are otherwise Turing complete.

### Example
  Sed and Awk are Turing complete,  Regular Expression is not turing complete
