## 1、Kafka的整体结构
![Kafka-Apis](http://kafka.apache.org/22/images/kafka-apis.png)

Kafka has four core APIs:

The Producer API allows an application to publish a stream of records to one or more Kafka topics.

The Consumer API allows an application to subscribe to one or more topics and process the stream of records produced to them.

The Streams API allows an application to act as a stream processor, consuming an input stream from one or more topics and producing an output stream to one or more output topics, effectively transforming the input streams to output streams.

The Connector API allows building and running reusable producers or consumers that connect Kafka topics to existing applications or data systems. For example, a connector to a relational database might capture every change to a table.
