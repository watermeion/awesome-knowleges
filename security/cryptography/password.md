## What's weak password?

### Definition (from wikipedia)
As with any security measure, passwords vary in effectiveness (i.e., strength); some are weaker than others. For example, the difference in weakness between a dictionary word and a word with obfuscation (i.e., letters in the password are substituted by, say, numbers — a common approach) may cost a password cracking device a few more seconds; this adds little strength. The examples below illustrate various ways weak passwords might be constructed, all of which are based on simple patterns which result in extremely low entropy, allowing them to be tested automatically at high speeds

### Example

 - Default passwords (as supplied by the system vendor and meant to be changed at installation time): password, default, admin, guest, etc. Lists of default passwords are widely available on the internet.
 - **Dictionary words**: chameleon, RedSox, sandbags, bunnyhop!, IntenseCrabtree, etc., including words in non-English dictionaries.
 - **Words with numbers appended**: password1, deer2000, john1234, etc., can be easily tested automatically with little lost time.
 - **Words with simple obfuscation**: p@ssw0rd, l33th4x0r, g0ldf1sh, etc., can be tested automatically with little additional effort. For example, a domain administrator password compromised in the DigiNotar attack was reportedly Pr0d@dm1n.[32]
Doubled words: crabcrab, stopstop, treetree, passpass, etc.
 - **Common sequences from a keyboard row**: qwerty, 12345, asdfgh, fred, etc.
Numeric sequences based on well known numbers such as 911 (9-1-1, 9/11), 314159... (pi), 27182... (e), 112 (1-1-2), etc.
 - **Identifiers** : jsmith123, 1/1/1970, 555–1234, one's username, etc.
 - Weak passwords in non-English languages, such as contraseña (Spanish) and ji32k7au4a83 (encoding from Chinese)[33]
 - Anything personally related to an individual: license plate number, Social Security number, current or past telephone numbers, student ID, current address, previous addresses, birthday, sports team, relative's or pet's names/nicknames/birthdays/initials, etc., can easily be tested automatically after a simple investigation of a person's details.
**Dates**: dates follow a pattern and make your password weak.
