## Why the security of passwords is so important?

* 越来越多使用密码的场景出现，比如工作，购物，游戏，但是这些服务采取的安全认证方式都是密码登录
* Passwords and passcodes are the most common way of authenticating users.

## By what way our passwords is lost

* Keystroke logging
* Phishing
* A brute force attack
* Yours passwords is kept in insecure locations


## What's weak password

### Definition (from wikipedia)

As with any security measure, passwords vary in effectiveness (i.e., strength); some are weaker than others. For example, the difference in weakness between a dictionary word and a word with obfuscation (i.e., letters in the password are substituted by, say, numbers — a common approach) may cost a password cracking device a few more seconds; this adds little strength. The examples below illustrate various ways weak passwords might be constructed, all of which are based on simple patterns which result in extremely low entropy, allowing them to be tested automatically at high speeds

### Example

 - **Default passwords** (as supplied by the system vendor and meant to be changed at installation time): password, default, admin, guest, etc. Lists of default passwords are widely available on the internet.
 - **Dictionary words**: chameleon, RedSox, sandbags, bunnyhop!, IntenseCrabtree, etc., including words in non-English dictionaries.
 - **Words with numbers appended**: password1, deer2000, john1234, etc., can be easily tested automatically with little lost time.
 - **Words with simple obfuscation**: p@ssw0rd, l33th4x0r, g0ldf1sh, etc., can be tested automatically with little additional effort. For example, a domain administrator password compromised in the DigiNotar attack was reportedly Pr0d@dm1n.[32]
**Doubled words**: crabcrab, stopstop, treetree, passpass, etc.
 - **Common sequences from a keyboard row**: qwerty, 12345, asdfgh, fred, etc.
Numeric sequences based on well known numbers such as 911 (9-1-1, 9/11), 314159... (pi), 27182... (e), 112 (1-1-2), etc.
 - **Identifiers** : jsmith123, 1/1/1970, 555–1234, one's username, etc.
 - **Weak passwords in non-English languages**, such as contraseña (Spanish) and ji32k7au4a83 (encoding from Chinese)[33]
 - **Anything personally related to an individual**: license plate number, Social Security number, current or past telephone numbers, student ID, current address, previous addresses, birthday, sports team, relative's or pet's names/nicknames/birthdays/initials, etc., can easily be tested automatically after a simple investigation of a person's details.
- **Dates**: dates follow a pattern and make your password weak.

## Password Security Tips?
- Don’t use simple, easy to guess passwords such as names of friends, family and pets. Don’t use words from the dictionary or commonly used passwords such as 12345 or QWERTY.
- Don’t share passwords with other people. If they need access to data they should be given their own login.
- Don’t leave passwords lying around in notebooks, or on sticky notes close to your computer, or in files on your computer where they can easily be read.
- Before you enter a password into a website, make sure it is using a secure connection beginning with https:// (it might also show a small padlock close to the address) this means the site is using a secure link that cannot be intercepted by attackers.
- When you register with some online services they will send you a password so that you can log in. Many sites force you to change the password when you first log in, if they don’t, change it when you first visit the site.
- If possible, change the default password on devices such as your internet router. This is programmed at the factory and some companies have a single password for all their devices. An attacker only needs to know the make of your router to gain access.
- If you have trouble remembering passwords try a password manager program that not only stores passwords, but can generate new, highly complex passwords for you.
- Two-factor authentication gives you additional protection as it requires two pieces of information (such as a password and a random number sent by SMS) to provide access to your data. If a company offers two-factor authentication, you should use it.
